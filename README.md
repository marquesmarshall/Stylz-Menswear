# Stylz Menswear
 I'm just trying to feed my family!!! :-(
   what up y'all

1. Beautify all pages. Some look good, some do not
2. Check all pages for content outside of the body tags. I noticed an h1 on the apparel page.
3. Parent/Child relationships are off on the deals page. Also have content outside of body.
4. Comments look great on index, but other pages need work.
5. Minor issues with styling for a tablet or phone.


Looks like your focus needs to be with adding content to the site. The sturcture is all there and, aside from a couple of html files that need to be beautified, your code is very clean. You have done an amazing job with this, and most groups have not grasped it. You will have a really nice website as long as you can get the content into it on time.
